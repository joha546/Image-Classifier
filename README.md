# Image Classification with PyTorch

This repository contains code for image classification using PyTorch. It includes scripts for training a neural network model on a custom dataset, testing the trained model, and making predictions on new images. Additionally, it provides utilities for keeping a Jupyter notebook session active and for sending keep-alive requests to the Udacity workspace.

## Files

- **predict.py**: This script is used to make predictions on new images using a trained model checkpoint.

- **train.py**: This script is used to train a neural network model on a custom dataset. It includes options for specifying hyperparameters such as learning rate, number of hidden units, and number of epochs.

- **workspace_utils.py**: This module provides utilities for keeping a Jupyter notebook session active and for sending keep-alive requests to the Udacity workspace.

## Usage

### Training a Model

To train a model, use the `train.py` script. You need to provide the path to your dataset using the `data_directory` argument. Additionally, you can specify optional arguments such as `--save_dir` to specify the directory to save the trained model checkpoint, `--gpu` to train the model on GPU, `--arch` to choose the architecture of the pre-trained network, `--learning_rate` to set the learning rate, `--hidden_units` to set the number of units in the fully-connected hidden layer, and `--epochs` to specify the number of training epochs.

Example usage:
```
python train.py flowers --save_dir checkpoints --gpu --arch vgg11 --learning_rate 0.001 --hidden_units 512 --epochs 10
```

### Making Predictions

To make predictions on new images, use the `predict.py` script. You need to provide the path to the image file and the path to the model checkpoint file. Optionally, you can specify `--category_names` to provide a mapping of category labels to names, `--gpu` to use GPU for prediction, and `--top_k` to specify the number of top predicted classes to return.

Example usage:
```
python predict.py flowers/test/1/image_06743.jpg checkpoints/checkpoint.pth --category_names cat_to_name.json --gpu --top_k 5
```

### Keeping Session Active

The `workspace_utils.py` module provides utilities for keeping a Jupyter notebook session active. You can use the `active_session` context manager to keep a session active during long-running tasks.

Example usage:
```python
from workspace_utils import active_session

with active_session():
    # long-running task here
```
